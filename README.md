# ASCII-3D-first-person-sandbox-game
Created a basic 3D first person sandbox game only using ASCII characters and the windows terminal entirely from scratch. You move around a map, look in any direction, strafe and jump around. I referenced this video for this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw
